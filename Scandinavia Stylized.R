Scandinavia is a subregion in Northern Europe, with strong historical, cultural,

Scandinavian Peninsula (which excludes Denmark but includes a part of northern Finland). 
In English usage, Scandinavia is sometimes used as a synonym for Nordic countries. 
Iceland and the Faroe Islands are sometimes included in Scandinavia for their 
ethnolinguistic relations with Sweden, Norway and Denmark. While Finland differs

The region became notable during the Viking Age, when Scandinavian peoples participated

which comprised large parts of Scandinavia and Great Britain, though it was relatively 
short-lived. Scandinavia was eventually Christianized, and the coming centuries 
saw various unions of Scandinavian nations, most notably the Kalmar Union of Denmark, 
Norway and Sweden, which lasted for over 100 years until the Swedish king Gustav I 
led Sweden to independence. It also saw numerous wars between the nations, which 
shaped the modern borders. The most recent union was the union between Sweden and 
Norway, which ended in 1905.

In modern times the region has prospered, with the economies of the countries being 
amongst the strongest in Europe. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Finland 
all maintain welfare systems considered to be generous, with the economic and

The Viking Age (793â€“1066 CE) was the period during the Middle Ages when Norsemen 
known as Vikings undertook large-scale raiding, colonising, conquest, and trading 
throughout Europe and reached North America. It followed the Migration Period and 
the Germanic Iron Age. The Viking Age applies not only to their homeland of Scandinavia 
but also to any place significantly settled by Scandinavians during the period. 
The Scandinavians of the Viking Age are often referred to as Vikings as well as 
Norsemen, although few of them were Vikings in the sense of being engaged in piracy."

settled in the British Isles, Ireland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, 
Normandy, and the Baltic coast and along the Dnieper and Volga trade routes in 
eastern Europe, where they were also known as Varangians. They also briefly settled 
in Newfoundland, becoming the first Europeans to reach North America. The Norse-Gaels, 
Normans, Rus' people, Faroese, and Icelanders emerged from these Norse colonies. 
The Vikings founded several kingdoms and earldoms in Europe: the Kingdom of the 
Isles (SuÃ°reyjar), Orkney (NorÃ°reyjar), York (JÃ³rvÃ­k) and the Danelaw (DanalÇ«g), 
Dublin (Dyflin), Normandy, and Kievan Rus' (GarÃ°arÃ­ki). The Norse homelands were 
also unified into larger kingdoms during the Viking Age, and the short-lived North 
Sea Empire included large swathes of Scandinavia and Britain. In 1021, the Vikings 
achieved the feat of reaching North America - the date of which was not specified
